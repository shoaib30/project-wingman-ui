    <p class="details">PWM was started with the goal of making travel cheaper and encouraging people to travel more. It was meant to erase geographical boundaries. It was meant to celebrate diversity by experiencing various cultures of the world. It was meant to bring people closer to one another and make the world one closely knitted community. 
We realized that when people travel they necessarily don't carry the entire baggage weight they are allowed to carry but still pay the full flight price and that is when we knew we had an opportunity. We wondered, 'What if we could monetize this spare baggage space?' </p>
<p class="details">Doing this would lead to:<br>
• People traveling at cheaper prices.<br>
• Courier which was up to 8 times cheaper and atleast 2 times faster. <br>
We felt like this had to be it. These had to be our first steps in making the world a closely well- knit community. </p>

<p class="details">You want to travel the world or send stuff from one corner of the earth to another? 
Allow us to be your Wingman! :)</p>
